#MMD2PDF Manual ![MMD2PDF][]

MMD2PDF can be used to convert (Multi)MarkDown documents to PDF documents.
It is a portable utility, it will leave no traces in registry.

##Usage
MMD2PDF.exe is a commandline executable.

##Settings
mmd2pdf is made to be as flexible as possible, but with a lot of default options to use immediately.
There are three files which define the transforming process and how a document will look:

* The preferences - mmd2pdf.prf
* The defintions - [documentname].def
* The styles - [stylename].sty

###The preferences
The preferences for MMD2PDF can be defined by the mmd2pdf.prf file which is located in same directory as the mmd2pdf.exe file.

The following preferences can be used:

    OpenDocument: yes/no
    AutoOverwrite: yes/no
    AutoNewLines: yes/no - when yes, RETURN becomes a literal newline
    Test: [Undocumented Feature]

Also any wkhtmltopdf option can be used, for example:

    --print-media-type
    --orientation Portrait
    --margin-top 10mm
    --margin-bottom 10mm
    --margin-right 10mm
    --margin-left 10mm
    --page-size A4
    --disable-external-links
    --redirect-delay 0
    --disable-javascript

### The definitions
The definitions for a document, how a document is processed, can be defined in the [pagename].def file in the same directory as the document.
For example, if the Markdown document is document.txt the definitions file will be the document.def file.

The following definitions can be used:

 * Style=[style] (without .css or .sty)
 * PageBreakAtTopLevel
 * MultiMarkDown definitions.  
   The MultiMarkDown executable will handle these definitions as if they are on top of the page.
 * MultiMarkDown Image/Link references, after an empty line.  
   The MultiMarkDown executable will handle these references as if they are in the document. This makes it possible to seperate the references from the document.

### The Styles
MMD2PDF comes with a number of styles, for example: 

* default - basic black and white pages
* documentation - blue headers and tables, header and footer support
* presentation - for fullscreen pdf slides  
For viewing PDF presentations I recommend [SumatraPDF](http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/free-pdf-reader.html), the key combination Ctrl-L puts the display in presentation mode.

###Creating your own styles
A mmd2pdf style consists of a .css and a .sty file.
For the [stylename].css any css styling can be used, but there are some considerations: 

* Scrollbars  
  Sometimes scrollbars will appear, for example if an image is larger than the page size. To prevent this the image or text must be made smaller. No scrollbars will be shown if the following css style is used (the *default* style has this behavior):  
  `::-webkit-scrollbar { display: none; }`
* The best way to handle large images and text blocks is to use `max-width: 100%;`

In the [stylename].sty any of the wkhtmltopdf option can be used, it will override options defines in mmd2pdf.prf.

#PDF Slides
A PDF Slides document is simply a pdf which contains pages made to be displayed on a screen or beamer instead of paper. When displayed fullscreen such a pdf can be used as a simple powerpoint presentation.

This can be done by creating pages which have a screen-like aspect orientation. One way to achieve this is to use landscape orientation. Usually a larger font size will be used for the slides.

SumatraPDF has a presentation mode, which can be activated by the key combination Ctrl-L.

To create Markdown Slides with mmd2pdf:

* Use one of these styles:
    * presentation - for general use.
    * presentation-4x3 - for a 1600*1200 or 800*600 (4:3 aspect ratio) screen or beamer.
    * presentation-16x9 - for a 1600*1200 or 800*600 (16:9 aspect ratio) screen or beamer.
    * markdown1 - Demo style

* Keep the text on one page
    This prevents webkit from applying pagebreaks.

#Pagebreaks
Don't let Webkit decide where to put pagebreaks for you because you won't like the result!

To start a line of text at the beginning of a new page a pagebreak kan be used.
The pagebreak identifier is : \[PAGEBREAK\] on a seperate line.

It is also possible to place every start of a markdown top level (except the first) at a different page, by adding `PageBreakAtTopLevel: 1` to the [pagename].def file.

##Special characters
Special characters for pronunciation (diacritics) will be correctly converted, whether the source file is in ANSI, UTF-8 or UTF-8 without BOM encoding. Examples of these characters are:
> á, ä, à, â, æ, ç, é, ë, è, ê, í, ï, ì, î, ó, ö, ò, ô, š, ú, ü, ù, û

SumatraPDF
==========
The most PDF Readers will not update the view if the pdf changes. This is not a nice if you want to view the results often: first the PDF Reader must be closed, the mmd2pdf must be started which will launch the PDF Reader again.

But SumatraPDF automatically refreshes the display if a new new pdf is created. It does not have to be closed down to view the new PDF.

Another reason to use SumatraPDF is the presentation mode, this will show one PDF in full screen. 

Text Editor support
===================
MMD2PDF can easily be used in a text editor. For example in Notepad++, create this Execute command:

    $(NPP_DIRECTORY)\MMD2PDF\MMD2PDF.exe "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)"
